This model provides a simple interactive simulation of the Capability Trap.

Repenning and Sterman (2001, 2002) developed the theory of the capability trap to explain the failure of many process improvement programs.  Sterman (2015) applies the theory to sustainability and pro-social investments; Lyneis and Sterman (2016) expand the theory to the case of energy efficiency in a large research University.

The managers of any process, whether production, product development, maintenance, human resources, or environmental quality, are responsible for the performance of that process against target or desired performance.  If performance falls short of the target, managers have two basic options to close the gap:  working harder or working smarter.  
12,6,0,378,158,374,43,8,135,0,32,-1,0,0,0,-1--1--1,0-0-0,Arial|12||0-0-0
Working harder includes adding resources (hiring, capacity expansion), increasing resource utilization (overtime, shorter breaks, speeding up), and boosting output per person-hour by cutting corners (skipping steps, cutting testing, deferring maintenance, failing to follow safety procedures).  These activities form the balancing (i.e., negative) Work Harder feedback, B1:  a performance shortfall leads to longer hours, corner cutting, deferring maintenance, and other shortcuts that improve performance.  
12,7,0,380,220,370,30,8,135,0,32,-1,0,0,0,-1--1--1,0-0-0,Arial|12||0-0-0
Alternatively, managers can interpret the performance gap as a sign that the organization’s capabilities are inadequate.  They can increase improvement activity designed to eliminate the root causes of poor performance and invest in the capabilities that make improvement effort effective, including investments that enhance people’s skills, knowledge of and adherence to best practices, and build cooperation and trust across organizational boundaries.  
12,8,0,381,260,253,10,8,135,0,32,-1,0,0,0,-1--1--1,0-0-0,Arial|12||0-0-0
Investing in capability improvement forms the balancing Work Smarter feedback, B2. 
12,9,0,373,301,376,31,8,135,0,32,-1,0,0,0,-1--1--1,0-0-0,Arial|12||0-0-0
The organization’s capabilities are shown as a stock.  Capabilities—including productive, well-maintained equipment, skilled workers, effective improvement methods, organizational routines, and trust between workers and management and across organizational boundaries—are assets that build up as the result of investment and erode over time as equipment ages, employees leave, and changes in the environment render skills, knowledge, routines and relationships obsolete.
12,10,0,373,359,366,28,8,135,0,32,-1,0,0,0,-1--1--1,0-0-0,Arial|12||0-0-0
Working harder and working smarter interact because time and resources are limited.  When organizations are heavily loaded and resources constrained, greater work effort necessarily comes at the expense of maintenance, improvement, learning, training, coordination and other activities needed to preserve and enhance capabilities. 
12,11,0,377,404,353,23,8,135,0,32,-1,0,0,0,-1--1--1,0-0-0,Arial|12||0-0-0
The result is the reinforcing (i.e., positive) feedback denoted Reinvestment or Ruin (R1).  As the name suggests, the reinforcing feedback can operate as a virtuous cycle that builds capabilities and performance, or as a vicious cycle that degrades both.  
12,12,0,387,455,374,41,8,135,0,32,-1,0,0,0,-1--1--1,0-0-0,Arial|12||0-0-0
An organization that increases the time and resources devoted to improvement sufficiently will, after a lag, build capabilities that boost performance, easing the performance gap and yielding still more time and resources for improvement.  In contrast, if managers respond to a performance gap with greater pressure to boost output, improvement effort falls, the organization’s capabilities erode, and the throughput gap grows still larger, forcing ever-greater reliance on working harder.  
12,13,0,389,507,373,19,8,135,0,32,-1,0,0,0,-1--1--1,0-0-0,Arial|12||0-0-0
The vicious cycle drives out improvement activity, leading to low capabilities and poor performance, and, all too often, environmental damage, accidents, or organizational failure.
