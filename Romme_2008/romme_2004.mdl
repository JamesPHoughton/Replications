Actual Decision Rate 1=
	Adapted Normal Decision Rate * Issues Discussed First Time / (Issues Discussed First Time\
		 + Issues Discussed Second Time)
	~	Issues/Meeting [0,?]
	~	The rate at which the system succeeds in taking unanimous decisions on issues \
		discussed for the first time.
		We assume the system distributes its attention in any meeting between \
		issues discussed for the first and those discussed for the second time – \
		this distribution is assumed to be proportional (Issues Discussed First \
		Time divided by the total number of issues discussed)
	|

Decision Failure Rate=
	Issues Discussed Second Time - Actual Decision Rate 2
	~	Issues/Meeting [0,?]
	~	The rate at which the system fails to take unanimous decisions (after these issues \
		have been discussed in two subsequent meetings).
		This is the number of issues discussed for the second time in the current \
		meeting, minus those issues on which decisions are made.
	|

Actual Decision Rate 2=
	Adapted Normal Decision Rate * Issues Discussed Second Time/(Issues Discussed First Time\
		 + Issues Discussed Second Time)
	~	Issues/Meeting [0,?]
	~	The rate at which the system succeeds in taking unanimous decisions on issues \
		discussed for the second time.
		The system distributes its attention in each meeting between issues \
		discussed for the first and for the second time – this distribution is \
		assumed to be proportional (Issues Discussed Second Time divided by the \
		total number of issues discussed).
	|

Adapted Normal Decision Rate=
	Normal Decision Rate * Effect on Shared Effort * Effect on Time and Resources to Build Unanimity
	~	Issues/Meeting [0,?]
	~	The cumulative effect of decision pressure on shared effort and the time & \
		resources to build unanimity on the normal decision capacity.
	|

Agenda Cap=
	6
	~	Issues/Meeting [0,?]
	~	The agenda capacity for one meeting, that is, the total number of issues \
		that can be discussed in a single meeting.
	|

Agenda Placement Rate=
	MIN(Cap Issues First Time, Issues to be Decided)
	~	Issues/Meeting [0,?]
	~	The rate at which ’first time’ issues enter the agenda of the upcoming \
		meeting. ‘First time’ is in apostrophes in this definition because the \
		Issues To Be Decided may include ‘old’ issues being recycled (see \
		figure).
	|

Cap Issues First Time=
	Agenda Cap - Extended Discussion Rate
	~	 [0,?]
	~	The agenda capacity of the upcoming meeting for issues discussed for the first time. 
		This capacity is determined by the capacity of the whole meeting minus \
		issues that (were not decided upon in the previous meeting and) will be \
		discussed for the second time in the upcoming meeting.
	|

Decision Performance=
	(Actual Decision Rate 1 + Actual Decision Rate 2) / DELAY1(New Issue Inflow Rate, 1 \
		)
	~	Dmnl [0,?]
	~	The overall decision performance of the system, determined as a straightforward \
		output/input ratio: the sum of the two actual decision rates divided by \
		the new issue inflow rate.
		Because it takes at least one meeting to take a decision, the latter \
		variable is delayed for 1 meeting (t-1).
	|

Decision Pressure=
	Desired Decision Rate/Normal Decision Rate
	~	Dmnl [0,?]
	~	Decision Pressure is equal to the ratio of the desired and normal decision \
		rates. The higher the desired decision rate relative to how the system \
		normally performs, the higher the pressure on the participants in the \
		decision-making process.
	|

Decision Skills=
	1
	~	Dmnl
	~	The level of the decision skills of the participants in the system.
		This variable is standardized at 1.
	|

Desired Decision Rate=
	SMOOTH(Indicated Decision Rate, Time to Adapt Des Rate )
	~	 [0,?]
	~	The system's perception of how fast it needs to decide on issues. 
		The Desired Decision Rate is equal to a first order exponential smooth of \
		the indicated rate (SMOOTH1).
	|

Desired Time per Issue=
	1
	~	 [0,?]
	~	This is the intended decision time: the time interval, in terms of number \
		of meetings, in which

Extended Discussion Rate=
	Issues Discussed First Time - Actual Decision Rate 1
	~	Issues/Meeting [0,?]
	~	The rate at which the system moves decisions discussed for the first time to the \
		next meeting because they require extended discussion.
		This rate involves all Issues Discussed First Time minus those issues on \
		which decisions were taken in the same meeting.
	|

Group Size=
	10
	~	Persons [0,?]
	~	This is the total number of people participating in meetings and decisions taken in \
		these meetings.
		In the initial situation, the group size is set at 10 persons. In the \
		comparative analysis for different group sizes, the value of Group Size \
		varies.
	|

Indicated Decision Rate=
	Issues to be Decided/Desired Time per Issue
	~	Issues/Meeting [0,?]
	~	The system's required decision speed, as it directly follows from the \
		number of Issues To Be Decided divided by the number of meetings to be \
		spent on one issue.
	|

Issue Recycling Rate=
	DELAY1(Issues Undecided , Recycle Delay )
	~	Issues/Meeting [0,?]
	~	The rate at which the system recycles issues on which it has failed to make \
		unanimous decisions earlier.
		This rate is determined by the stock of Issues Undecided and the \
		RecycleDelay; that is, the DELAY function returns the value of Issues \
		Undecided after the given time delay.
	|

Issues Discussed First Time= INTEG (
	Agenda Placement Rate-Actual Decision Rate 1-Extended Discussion Rate,
		4)
	~	Issues [0,?]
	~	This is the stock of issues being discussed in the current meeting for the \
		first time; this stock is the result of the initial value of the stock \
		plus the inflow minus the outflows.
	|

Issues Discussed Second Time= INTEG (
	Extended Discussion Rate-Actual Decision Rate 2-Decision Failure Rate,
		0)
	~	 [0,?]
	~	The stock of issues being discussed for the second time (in the current \
		meeting); this stock is the result of the initial stock plus the inflow \
		minus outflows.
	|

Issues to be Decided= INTEG (
	Issue Recycling Rate+New Issue Inflow Rate-Agenda Placement Rate,
		4)
	~	Issues [0,?]
	~	This is the current stock of issues to be decided; this stock is the result of the \
		initial stock
		plus the accumulation of all inflows minus outflows since t = 0 (the first \
		meeting).
	|

Issues Undecided= INTEG (
	Decision Failure Rate-Issue Recycling Rate,
		0)
	~	Issues [0,?]
	~	The stock of issues that are undecided after being discussed in two \
		subsequent meetings
	|

New Issue Inflow Rate=
	4
	~	Issues/Meeting [0,?]
	~	The rate at which new issues arrive, that is, are added to the stock of \
		issues to be processed and decided; this is an exogenous variable in this \
		model.
	|

Normal Decision Rate=
	Decision Skills * SQRT(160/Group Size)
	~	Issues/Meeting [0,?]
	~	This is the system’s normal decision rate, determined by the level of decision \
		skills times an exponentially decreasing function of group size.
		The specification of the latter function as the square root of constant/GroupSize is \
		inspired by Einstein’s E=mc2 or c=SQRT(E/m).
		The value of the constant is set at 160 in this study; if Decision Skills \
		= 1, this gives a Normal Decision Rate = 4 for Group Size = 10, etcetera.

		,(2,1.9),(3,1.9))
	~	Dmnl
	~	This graph depicts the positive effects of decision pressure on the shared effort \
		made. Very low decision pressure tends to reduce the effort made; this \
		effect is limited however. A medium or ‘normal’ amount of decision \
		pressure (around 1) does not substantially influence the shared effort; \
		higher amounts of pressure have a increasingly strong effects on the \
		effort made, but at a certain point more pressure has no further effect on \
		performance.
		This graphical function is standardized at (1.00, 1.00) – if the input value is 1, \
		then the output is also 1.
		If DecisionPressure > 3, the effect is 1.90

		,(2.75,0.17),(3,0.14),(3.25,0.12),(3.5,0.11),(3.75,0.1),(4,0.1))
	~	Dmnl
	~	This graph depicts the negative effect of an increasing amount of Decision Pressure \
		on the ability to take decisions unanimously. The premise here is that \
		after a certain critical point, the system is overwhelmed by the amount of \
		pressure (because time and resources to develop unanimity – per issue \
		processed – are increasingly scarce) and is less able to deal with \
		individual participants or subgroups blocking proposed decisions.
		This graphical function is standardized at (1.00, 1.00) – if input is 1, then the \
		output is also 1.
		If Decision Pressure > 4, the resulting effect is 0.1
	|

Table for Recycle Delay(
	[(0,0)-(10,10)],(0,0),(1,0),(1.5,1),(2,1),(2.5,2),(3,2))
	~	Dmnl
	~	This graphical function defines the effects of decision pressure on the delay to \
		recycle issues that have not been decided yet.
		We assume that when decision pressure is lower than or equal to 1, the delay is 0. \
		With pressure increasing, the delay increases to 1 meeting and \
		subsequently 2 meetings. Thus, the graph is discontinuous in nature \
		(because a delay of for example 1.6 meeting does not make sense).
		If DecisionPressure > 3, the output value is 2. In this respect, we assume \
		that decisions on policy issues can be somewhat delayed, but not for a \
		longer period (even when decision pressure is very high).
	|

Time to Adapt Des Rate=
	2
	~	Meetings [0,?]
	~	The time (in meetings) required for the system to recognize that a new \
