	~	Price depends on perceived coverage, not instantaneous coverage, because \

	~	Dollars
	~	price is anchored on the Traders’ Expected price, representing \
		traders’ beliefs about the market-clearing price. Actual price is \
		adjusted up or down from the anchor in response to various pressures. In \
		this simple model, adjustments arise from the demand supply balance and \
		traders’ beliefs about the underlying costs of production.

Sensitivity of Price to Inventory Coverage=
